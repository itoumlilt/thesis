  abstract               = {Developers of cloud-scale applications
                            face a difficult decision of which kind of storage to
                            use, summarised by the CAP theorem. Currently the
                            choice is between classical CP databases, which
                            provide strong guarantees but are slow, expensive, and
                            unavailable under partition; and NoSQL-style AP
                            databases, which are fast and available, but too hard
                            to program against. We present an alternative: Cure
                            provides the highest level of guarantees that remains
                            compatible with availability. These guarantees
                            include: causal consistency (no ordering anomalies),
                            atomicity (consistent multi-key updates), and support
                            for high-level data types (developer friendly API)
                            with safe resolution of concurrent updates
                            (guaranteeing convergence). These guarantees minimise
                            the anomalies caused by parallelism and distribution,
                            thus facilitating the development of
                            applications. This paper presents the protocols for
                            highly available transactions, and an experimental
                            evaluation showing that Cure is able to achieve
                            scalability similar to eventually- consistent NoSQL
                            databases, while providing stronger guarantees.}

  abstract  = {Mobile devices commonly access shared data stored on a
               server. To ensure responsiveness, many applications
               maintain local replicas of the shared data that remain
               instantly accessible even if the server is slow or
               temporarily unavailable. Despite its apparent
               simplicity and commonality, this scenario can be
               surprisingly challenging. In particular, a correct and
               reliable implementation of the communication protocol
               and the conflict resolution to achieve eventual
               consistency is daunting even for experts.  To make
               eventual consistency more programmable, we propose the
               use of specialized cloud data types. These cloud types
               provide eventually consistent storage at the
               programming language level, and thus abstract the
               numerous implementation details (servers, networks,
               caches, protocols). We demonstrate (1) how cloud types
               enable simple programs to use eventually consistent
               storage without introducing undue complexity, and (2)
               how to provide cloud types using a system and protocol
               comprised of multiple servers and clients.}

  x-abstract_en          = {Comparisons of different consistency models often try
                            to place them in a linear strong-to-weak order.
                            However this view is clearly inadequate, since it is
                            well known, for instance, that Snapshot Isolation and
                            Serialisability are incomparable.  In the interest of
                            a better understanding, we propose a new
                            classification, along three dimensions, related to: a
                            total order of writes, a causal order of reads, and
                            transactional composition of multiple operations.  A
                            model may be stronger than another on one dimension
                            and weaker on another.  We believe that this new
                            classification scheme is both scientifically sound and
                            has good explicative value.  The current paper
                            presents the three-dimensional design space

  abstract               = {Large-scale distributed systems often rely on
                            replicated databases that allow a programmer to
                            request different data consistency guarantees for
                            different operations, and thereby control their
                            performance. Using such databases is far from trivial:
                            requesting stronger consistency in too many places may
                            hurt performance, and requesting it in too few places
                            may violate correctness. To help programmers in this
                            task, we propose the first proof rule for establishing
                            that a particular choice of consistency guarantees for
                            various operations on a replicated database is enough
                            to ensure the preservation of a given data integrity
                            invariant. Our rule is modular: it allows reasoning
                            about the behaviour of every operation separately
                            under some assumption on the behaviour of other
                            operations. This leads to simple reasoning, which we
                            have automated in an SMT-based tool. We present a
                            nontrivial proof of soundness of our rule and
                            illustrate its use on several examples.}
