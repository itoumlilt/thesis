Immediate response, autonomy and availability is brought to edge
applications, such as gaming, cooperative engineering, or in-the-field
information sharing, by distributing and replicating data at the edge.
However, application developers and users demand the highest
possible consistency guarantees, and specific support for group
collaboration.
To address this challenge, \system{} guarantees Transactional Causal
Plus Consistency (TCC+) globally, dovetailing with Snapshot Isolation
within edge groups.
To help with scalability, fault tolerance and security,
its logical communication topology is tree-like, with replicated roots
in the core cloud, but with the flexibility to migrate a node or a group.
Despite this hybrid approach, applications enjoy the same semantics
everywhere in the topology.
Our experiments show that local caching and peer groups improve
throughput and response time significantly, performance is not affected
in offline mode, and that migration is seamless.
