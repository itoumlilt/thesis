    \caption{Performance evaluation comparing throughput and latency of SwiftCloud, Automerge, Colony and Yjs. Using ColonyChat benchmark applications}
    \label{fig:plot-performance-soa}
\end{figure}

In this experiment, we compare system performance of three approaches
Yjs \cite{yjsyjsSh56:online}, 
Automerge \cite{kleppmann2018automerge} and our system \system{} when scaling up,
the setup for this experiment is exactly the same as in Section~\ref{sec:eval1}.

Figure~\ref{fig:plot-performance-soa} reports throughput vs. response time.
It uses a log-log scale;
down and to the right is better.
Load doubles from one point to the next, from 4 to 2024 clients.

Automerge requires more bandwidth because it stores the whole history and uses
fat metadata to identify transactions and clients.
All three approaches uses state-based CRDTs, 
\system{} performance is lower but remains very close to Yjs, 
this is expected from the consensus at SI Zones,
which we see as a trade-off to improve the average reconnection time and 
metadata size as we will see in the next section.

\subsection{Reconnection time}

\begin{center}
    \begin{table}[h]
        \captionof{table}{Average resynchronization time (in seconds).\label{tab:reconnection-time}}
    \begin{tabular}{ |m{6em}||m{5em}|m{5em}|m{5em}|m{5em}| } 
        \hline
        System & 4 clients & 8 clients & 16 clients & 32 clients\\ 
        \hline
        Automerge & 1.1s & 1.3s & 9.2s & 102s \\ 
        \hline
        Yjs & 4s & 8.3s & 14s & 73s \\ 
        \hline
        Colony & 0.9s & 1.1s & 4.2s & 8.3s \\ 
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{center}

We now present the performance analysis when the network between the clients 
and the server is disrupted,
running the same workload presented in Section~\ref{sec:eval1},
with an increased disconnection rate (10\%).
And as in Section~\ref{sec:eval3} we measured the average synchronization time
when a client is connected back to its failure point, 
or (in the Colony case) when it switches to another sync point.

Table~\ref{tab:reconnection-time} shows the results of this experiment,
thanks to its ability to synchronize from multiple points of failure,
the forest topology
and its migration feature,
\system{} achieves an under 10s synchronization time while increasing the number
of group clients.
While in Automerge and Yjs, 
that needs a single failure point to synchronize 
a peer-to-peer group after failure,
the synchronization time increases exponentially.

\subsection{Metadata and implementation features comparison}

        \captionof{table}{Features and metadata comparison of similar systems.\label{tab:soa-compatison}}
    \begin{tabular}{ |m{6em}||m{3em}|m{3em}|m{3em}|m{3em}|m{3em}||m{3em}|m{3em}|m{3em}| } 
        \hline
        System & Edge CRDTs + Offline & Edge Metadata & P2P Groups & Client Migration & Txn Movement & Brower Support & IoT Support & Web Server\\ 
        \hline
        WebCure & Yes & O(N) & No & No & No & No & No & Yes \\ 
        \hline
        SwiftCloud & Yes & O(1) & No & Yes & No & No & No & Yes \\ 
        \hline
        Legion & Yes & O(N) & Yes & No & No & Yes & No & Yes \\ 
        \hline
        Automerge & Yes & O(N) & Yes & No & No & Yes & Yes & Yes \\ 
        \hline
        Yjs & Yes & O(N) & Yes & No & No & Yes & Yes & Yes \\ 
        \hline
        Colony & Yes & O(1) & Yes & Yes & Yes & No & No & Yes \\ 
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{center}

This last section
illustrates in Table~\ref{tab:soa-compatison} the set of features our approach
offers while keeping low metadata overhead. 

As presented in Section~\ref{sec:group-txn},
our approach relies on EPaxos \cite{syn:rep:1843} within the peer group.
Committed transactions become visible in the order
assigned by EPaxos.
In addition to improving the user experience, consensus is essential to
correct metadata management. 
Thanks to this choice, \system{} has a low metadata size compared to other 
approaches, while maintaining a similar performance \ref{fig:plot-performance-soa},
and many edge features.

However, the current implementation of \system{} can only be used as a local web server,
which restricts the type of devices it can be executed on (computers and laptops mostly),
In-Browser (Service Workers) or IoT devices are future work development.
