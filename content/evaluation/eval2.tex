single group of users in a channel (has already fulfilled its cache)
there are disconnected after some time
workspace w. 36 users/ 36 clients
the peer group contains 12 users; the rest is directly connected to the DC.
in red, we measure the response time for these guys
in blue, hit locally within the peer group
in green, hit within the group but not local.

We now evaluate how the response time varies under offline collaboration, or 
when the sync point of a group fails to connect to a DC.
%
To this end, we use a single \system{}Chat workspace that contains 36 users.
We pack 12 of these users in a peer group, whereas the others remain independent.
All users start with a warmed-up cache.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:plot-rt-offline-dc} shows the response time perceived at each 
user during the experiment.
%
Each dot in this figure corresponds to a transaction.

In Figure~\ref{fig:plot-rt-offline-dc}, we observe that the response time for local 
cache hits is near zero (in blue).
Users that belong to the same peer group benefit from an average 2.3~ms response time 
when data is fetched from the collaborative cache (in green).
This raises to around 82~ms when the user needs to perform a remote read from 
the DC (in red).

Approximately 25~s after the start of the experiment, 
the peer group goes offline, 
and only collaborates on its shared interest set of objects.
After this event, we observe that both the local and peer response time is unchanged:
users in the group will not observe remote transactions due to the 
disconnection, 
but they continue their collaboration seamlessly.
%
Around 45~s after the beginning of the experiment, 
the group is then reconnected to the DC.
In Figure~\ref{fig:plot-rt-offline-dc}, 
we can observe a slight increase of the response time at the reconnection, 
yet it has minimal impact on performance.

In Figure~\ref{fig:plot-rt-offline-pop}, 
we consider the same workload but this time disconnect a user from its peer 
group.
The disconnection occurs after 25~s and the user reconnects 20~s later.
In this figure, 
we may observe that the response time of the \system{}Chat application is slightly impacted
by the reconnection to the peer group.
Upon reconnecting to the peer group, 
the user notices a slight increase (below the millisecond) in its transactions.
This variation comes from the fact that the channels were updated with the new 
content published by the users in the peer group.
