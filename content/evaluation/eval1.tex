In this first experiment, we evaluate system performance when scaling
up, increasing the number of clients until performance saturates.
We compare three approaches.
One emulates AntidoteDB \cite{antidote-website}, a classical geo-replicated
approach, where a client does not have a local cache, and must contact
the DC for each operation.
Another emulates SwiftCloud \cite{rep:pan:sh177}, where
clients have a local cache but do not form peer groups.
Finally, the \system{} label indicates a system with peer groups
enabled.
In each case, we evaluate a deployment with a single DC and one with
three DCs.

Figure~\ref{fig:plot-performance} reports throughput vs.~response time.
It uses a log-log scale; down and to the right is better.
Load doubles from one point to the next, from 4 to 1024 clients.
As expected, at the beginning of the curve, throughput improves and
response time remains stable.
At some point, throughput levels out and response time degrades,
indicating saturation.

Observe that the \system{}'s response time is approximately 5 times
better than Swiftcloud's, which itself performs one order of magnitude
better than AntidoteDB (both for throughput and response time).
%
This difference is explained by the caching policy.
AntidoteDB does not have a client-side cache.
In the SwiftCloud configuration, 90\% of transactions hit the local
cache.
The hit rate reaches 95\% in the shared cache of the \system{} peer group
configuration.

Adding more DCs spreads the load in the AntidoteDB configuration,
improving the maximum throughput of the system, by 40\% from a single to
three DCs.
However, adding more data centers does not improve response time, 
since clients need still to contact them for each operation.
This is \speedup{8} slower than the SwiftCloud configuration.
%
In contrast, the number of DCs has a minor impact in the SwiftCloud and
\system{} configurations.
